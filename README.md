## Methodology
### Feature Engineering
1. Lag Features: sensor "X"_lag_1 (value of previous cycle, where "X" denotes sensor number)
2. Rolling Features: 10-cycle moving mean/standard deviation
3. Noise Reduction: Dropped weakly correlated sensors (1, 5, 10, 16, 18, 19)

### Models
| Model            | NASA Score | Training Time (s) |  
|------------------|------------|-------------------|  
| Linear Regression| 15.60      | 0.01              |  
| Random Forest    | 13.68      | 0.13              |  
| **XGBoost**      | **10.60**  | 0.02              |

*Benchmarked on AMD Ryzen 7 5800H (16 threads), 16GB RAM*

## Results
### Top Predictive Features (for XGBoost model)
1. sensor 15_r_mean_10\* (sensor 15 = Bypass ratio): Indicates fan efficieny loss. Raises the overall temparature of the engine.
2. sensor 21_r_mean_10\* (sensor 21 = Low Pressure Turbine Coolant Bleed): Indicates clogged coolant bleeding paths. As a result, exhaust temperatures rise.
3. sensor 20_r_mean_10\* (sensor 20 = High Pressure Turbine Coolant Bleed): Indicates clogged coolant bleeding paths. As a result, High Pressure Compressor outlet temperatures rise.

**\*r_mean_10 denotes a rolling mean with a window of 10.**
